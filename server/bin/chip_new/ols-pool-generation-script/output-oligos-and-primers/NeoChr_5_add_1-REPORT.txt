	The primer sets correspond to plate index 2 and position index 2 in the standard plate-based amplification scheme.
	

Processed sequence yeast_chr1_3_16.A1.01

Success: Correctly designed oligos for yeast_chr1_3_16.A1.01-BtsI 
		First amplify this sequence using 'plate specific' primers skpp-1-F and skpp-1-R
		Next amplify this sequence using 'position specific' primers skpp-203-F and skpp-203-R
		Finally amplify this sequence using building block primers skpp-103-F and skpp-103-R
